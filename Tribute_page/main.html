      <h3 id="life-story">Pulwama terror attack: What happened on Feb 14</h3>
      <p>
        The 2019 Pulwama attack occurred on 14 February 2019, when a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian security personnel on the Jammu–Srinagar 
        National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethapora (near Awantipora) in the Pulwama district of the erstwhile 
        state of Jammu and Kashmir. The attack killed 40 Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel as well as the perpetrator—Adil 
        Ahmad Dar—who was a local Kashmiri youth from the Pulwama district. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-
        based Islamist terrorist group, Jaish-e-Mohammed.India blamed neighbouring Pakistan for the attack, while the latter condemned 
        the attack and denied having any connections to it. The attack dealt a severe blow to India–Pakistan relations, consequently 
        resulting in the 2019 India–Pakistan military standoff.
        The convoy from Jammu has plied only thrice in the last fortnight, as snow blocked road and CRPF 
        jawans were stranded in Jammu since February 4. 16 vehicles dropped out at Qazigund on reaching destination but 16 ‘mobile bunkers’ 
        joined convoy to deal with terrorist ambushes which increase beyond Qazigund. The convoy left Qazigund at 2:38 pm. At Latoomode of
         Awantipora in Pulwama, an explosive laden vehicle entered the Jammu-Srinagar highway from a left bylane. It overtook a bus, 
         fifth in the convoy and exploded. The bus was blown to smithereens. The sixth bus was also impacted by the blast.

        The convoy of 78 vehicles, transporting 2,547 jawans, left Jammu transit camp at 3:30 am. 
        The jawans were returning from leave or going to areas of deployment
         Around 40 CRPF jawans died, 39 in the 5th bus and one from the ROP.
          Five more men in the sixth bus were injured

         This is the first time a suicide bomber in an explosive laden vehicle has attacked a CRPF convoy. 
         About 80kg of explosives was used for the attack.
         "All tears will be avenged" and the armed forces have been given "full freedom to decide the place, time, intensity and nature of the 
         retaliation against the enemy. "I feel the same fire in my heart that's raging inside you," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.
          Nationwide protests erupted against the dastardly terror attack. Several countries including Pakistan's all-weather friend 
          China condemned the attack.
          Around 12 days after the terror attack, in the wee hours of February 26, Indian Air Force jets bombed 
          the JeM camp in Balakot, in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
